Text Encryption/Decryption

    Supported algorithms: AES, DES, CAMELLIA, ChaCha20-Poly1305, XChaCha20-Poly1305, and Aegis256.
    Intuitive interface to enter text, choose an algorithm, and get the encrypted or decrypted result.

Generate 256-bit Key Automatically

    Automatically generate random 256-bit keys in the Manage Keys section.
    Ideal for encrypting/decrypting without manually creating keys.

Share/Import Encryption Keys via QR

    Share any key you’ve created so others can use the same encryption key.
    Export your key by pressing it in the list and choosing “Export.”
    Import a key using a QR code in “Import key via QR” under key management.

File Encryption/Decryption

    Select files from your device.
    Encrypt or decrypt them using the same algorithms.
    The output file name is automatically labeled “.encrypted” or “.decrypted.”

Built-In Key Manager :key:

    Add, delete, or generate random keys.
    Import keys from QR codes or export them as QR codes too.
    Keys are stored securely (using EncryptedSharedPreferences).

Share Encryption Flow

    Use the Share action in other apps → choose “Encrypt” or “Decrypt” for text/files.
    Quick and convenient for multi-app workflows.

Optional Accessibility Service :handshake:

    Detects selected text (when you highlight text on-screen).
    Detects copied text (clipboard).
    Displays a notification to encrypt/decrypt on the fly, opening the same activity (DialogFlowEncryptionActivity) with “Choose Operation.”

Toggle Accessibility Logic

    A “BurbujaEncryption” button (or similar) enables/disables the logic internally without turning off the service in Android Settings.
    Perfect for pausing detection without leaving system settings.

Dialog Flow (DialogFlowEncryptionActivity) :speech_balloon:

    A step-by-step sequence:
        “Choose Operation” (Encrypt/Decrypt)
        “Choose Cipher”
        “Pick/Enter Key”
        Final result
    Offers a guided, user-friendly experience.

Android 13+ Support

    Requests POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission if you want to see notifications when text is selected or copied.

Basic Usage :rocket:
Main Screen

    Enter text and a key (or pick a saved key).
    Select the algorithm from the spinner.
    Tap Encrypt or Decrypt.
    Copy or share the resulting text.

File Encryption :file_folder:

    Tap “FILE ENCRYPTION” on the main screen (MainActivity).
    Choose a file and an output folder.
    Pick the algorithm and a key.
    Tap EXECUTE.

Accessibility (Optional)

    Enable it in Settings → Accessibility → “Encrypt-DecrypT Service.”
    Once enabled, selecting or copying text in any app triggers a notification.
    Tap it to open the DialogFlow (“Choose Operation”).
    In MainActivity, use “BurbujaEncryption” to enable or disable detection without turning the service off in Settings.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :question:

    How do I enable/disable the accessibility service logic without going to system settings?
        Use the “BurbujaEncryption” button in MainActivity. It toggles an internal SharedPreferences flag. If disabled, the service won’t process events even if it’s still enabled in system settings.

    What if I forget my key?
        You won’t be able to decrypt your text/file. Make sure you keep a record of your keys or store them in the Key Manager.

    Why am I not seeing notifications when copying text?
        On Android 13+, you must grant the POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission.
        Check that the accessibility service is enabled and the internal logic is not toggled off.
