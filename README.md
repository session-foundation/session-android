## Summary

Session integrates directly with [Oxen Service Nodes](https://docs.oxen.io/about-the-oxen-blockchain/oxen-service-nodes), which are a set of distributed, decentralized and Sybil resistant nodes. Service Nodes act as servers which store messages offline, and a set of nodes which allow for onion routing functionality obfuscating users' IP addresses. For a full understanding of how Session works, read the [Session Whitepaper](https://getsession.org/whitepaper).

## Verifying signatures

**Step 1:**

```
wget https://github.com/jagerman.gpg
gpg --import jagerman.gpg
```

**Step 2:**

Get the signed hash for this release. `SESSION_VERSION` needs to be updated for the release you want to verify.

```
export SESSION_VERSION=1.10.4
wget https://github.com/session-foundation/session-android/releases/download/$SESSION_VERSION/signatures.asc
```

**Step 3:**

Verify the signature of the hashes of the files.

```
gpg --verify signatures.asc 2>&1 |grep "Good signature from"
```

The command above should print "`Good signature from "Kee Jefferys...`". If it does, the hashes are valid but we still have to make the sure the signed hashes matches the downloaded files.

**Step 4:**

Make sure the two commands below returns the same hash. If they do, files are valid.

```
sha256sum session-$SESSION_VERSION-universal.apk
grep universal.apk signatures.asc
```
